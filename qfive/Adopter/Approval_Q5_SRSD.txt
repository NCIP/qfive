We have reviewed the Software Requirements Document for Q5 submitted by Dartmouth (original version available at http://gforge.nci.nih.gov/docman/view.php/42/420/caBIG_Requirements_and_Specification_Q5Project.doc )

We approve this document with the following edits.  We have checked in a version with our edits that is available at:
http://cabigcvs.nci.nih.gov/viewcvs/viewcvs.cgi/qfive/Adopter/caBIG_Requirements_Q5Project_with_OHSU_edits.doc 

Edits:

Page 9 - notes about dependencies - note that PROcess, caMassClass have their own dependencies which should also be noted
Page 9 - R software version.  We are currently using Q5 on R 2.2.0 on our Linux Box and it seems to be fine.
Page 11 - change [technical tag details...] to Please refer to architecture section in this document.

The following references do not exist in the current version of Q5.  We think they should either be removed or the software re-released with these modifications:

Page 9 - "Diseased" and "Nondiseased" classifications.  The package does not currently output a vector of classifications on the test set.

Page 9 - Data output format - Label:<tab>value 

Page 9 - graph of eigenvalues

Page 13 - Requirements 3.2 and 3.3
